# NPC dialogue

RuneLite utility to make it easier to transcribe NPC dialogue onto the wiki. Example: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Maedhros#Dialogue

Copies all NPC dialogue, player dialogue, dialogue options, and chosen options into a panel that can be copied from. This does minimal formatting â€“ the end user still needs to do some stuff before it goes on the wiki.

Instructions on use:
1. Click the RESET button before initiating conversation with each different NPC.
2. Do not use number keys to select options, only click.
3. Spacebar is fine to advance dialogue, but if it is held down there will be messages skipped.
